## 1. What it is

A student space that trains problem solving and critical thinking. The student tries first, then watches a
replay of a mathematician's thinking. The method is SMART (Scan, Math translate, Aim, Relate, Test) plus
« 👁 الملاحظة », observation used as a lens in every phase.

| Path | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · « سُلَّم التحدّيات » | numbered puzzles outside the curriculum, primary → university, band hidden | **implemented** (phase 1) for independent students; the teacher request flow is *Planned* (phase 2) |
| 2 · « مسار المنهاج » | problems tied to each grade's lessons, the « مسرح العقل » | *Planned* (phase 6) |

**Bundle rule** ([`BUNDLE_BOUNDARIES.md`](./BUNDLE_BOUNDARIES.md) §3–§4):

- `packages/core/thinkingLab/*` is imported by path.
- The three pages are `lazy()`, the namespace `thinking` is on demand, and every figure is its own lazy chunk.
- The entry carries only the nav labels and `common.apiErrors.thinkingLab`. Measured on 2026-11-01: 237.8 KB gzip
  (budget 245); the `--chain features/thinkingLab` probe finds no path into the entry.
- `content/thinking-lab/` holds the answers. **No web module may import it**; `features/thinkingLab/serverOnly.test.js`
  scans the sources to enforce this.

## 3. Content model

### 3.1 A challenge

Every field is required, and `null` is written when a field does not apply. The exception is `whiteboard`,
which may be left out. The schema is `content/thinking-lab/_schema/challenge.schema.json`.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | stable slug. It never changes; links and progress use it. |
| `number` | position in the current edition. The file name is `String(number).padStart(4,'0')-<id>.json`. |
| `title` | Arabic title for authors and teachers. The student sees the number only (the presenter never sends it). |
| `status` | `draft` or `published`. In `--strict` mode nothing stays `draft` (owner rule). |
| `family` | `logic`, `numbers`, `patterns`, `algebra`, `geometry`, `counting`, `probability`, `functions`, `analysis`, `invariants` or `critical`. |
| `band` | **hidden**; it must match the number (§3.2). |
| `summit` | `true` exactly for multiples of 25. |
| `licence`, `source` | `PD`, `FOLK` or `TYPE`, plus what inspired it (challenge bank §1). Never a copied statement. |
| `examTag` | `bem`, `bac` or `null`; shown as « فكرة تتكرّر في امتحان … ». |
| `rating` | the author's initial estimate (Elo scale, 400–3000). |
| `statement` | Arabic text with maths in plain Unicode (no LaTeX). `{name}` placeholders are filled from `params`. Line breaks are kept on screen. |
| `figure` | `{kind: "svg", component, props}` or `null` (§7.2). |
| `whiteboard` | optional `{seed, observe[]}`: the observation targets. Unused until phase 3. |
| `params` | `{vars: {name: [values…]}}` or `null` (§3.3). |
| `answer` | §4. |
| `parts` | summits: 1 or more follow-ups `[{prompt, answer}]`, shown once the main answer is solved or the gate is open. The statement asks only the main question, and only `answer` drives the gate. |
| `mistakes` | frequent wrong answers and their « ليس بعد » reply (§4.3). |
| `keys` | 1–3 entries; a published challenge has exactly **3** (S → 👁 → R). Each key is a question and never gives the answer. |
| `example` | the primary band's worked example `{statement, steps[], answer}`, shown BEFORE trying. It is required for that band and `null` for the others. |
| `replay` | steps `{phase, think, layers?, math?, ask?}`. The phases are `S M A R T O B` (O = 👁 observation, B = ↩ dead end). |
| `keyMoves` | 1–3 sentences: the short replay for a student who solved alone. |
| `move` | `{id, title}`: the thinking move. Two challenges may share a move id; the card levels up in phase 4. |
| `twin` | the id of the twin challenge, or `null`. |
| `ceiling` | « ارفع السقف » `{statement, answer}`, or `null`. |

### 3.2 Hidden bands

| Numbers | Band | Mode (enforced by the gate, §6) |
|---|---|---|
| 1–120 | `primary` | example first (`example` required); the replay opens after 3 attempts **with no day of waiting** (`gate.primary_think_hours` = 0) |
| 121–260 | `middle` | try first: 3 attempts + 24 h |
| 261–420 | `secondary` | try first: 3 attempts + 24 h |
| 421+ | `university` | try first: 3 attempts + 24 h |

### 3.3 Per-student numbers (`params`)

- **Tuple choice:** a student's tuple is `fnv1a32("${userId}:${challengeId}:${edition}") mod tupleCount`.
  - The hash is FNV-1a, 32 bits, over UTF-8 bytes.
  - Variables are sorted by name, and the last one varies fastest.
- **Mirrors:** `params.js` and `Params.php` both pass `_fixtures/params.json`.
- **Storage:** the tuple index is stored in `thinking_lab_progress.params_index` when progress is created, so a change of
  edition never changes a student's numbers in the middle of a challenge.
- **Filling:** `{name}` is replaced in every string.
  - `answer.value`, `mistakes[].value` and `scaleWith` are filled **between parentheses** (`{a}^2` with a = −3 reads `(-3)^2`).
  - An `integer` or `rational` answer may therefore be a constant expression after filling (`{n}*({n}-1)/2`). It is read
    **exactly**: + − × ÷ and integer powers, through `exactValue` in JS and `AnswerChecker::exactValue` in PHP. √ and π are
    not allowed there; use `number`.
  - The screen shows the computed value (« 21 », never the filled template).

## 4. Checking an answer

### 4.1 Checks

| `answer.check` | How it is checked |
|---|---|
| `integer`, `rational` | the expected value is read exactly (§3.3), then the check is delegated to the practice evaluator (`answerEvaluator.js` / `AnswerEvaluator.php`) as `answerType: "rational"`. `tolerance` is a rational. The student types a number, fraction, decimal or %. |
| `choice` | delegated as `answerType: "choice"`. `value` is the id of the correct choice, and `choices` is `[{id, text}]`. |
| `number` | the answer is read as a rational, falling back to an expression with no variable (`π/4`, `e-2`), and compared with `relTol` (default 1e-6) and `absTol` (default 1e-9). With **`percent: true`**, « −4 % » or « −4 ٪ » is read as −4. |
| `expression` | equivalence by evaluation (§4.2). |

The outcomes are the practice outcomes: `correct`, `equivalent_correct`, `incorrect` and `syntax_error`.

- An unreadable or empty answer is a `syntax_error`, never an `incorrect`, and it is never counted (§6.2).
- Both `checkAnswer.js` and `AnswerChecker.php` return `{outcome, correct, normalized, mistakeIndex}`. They pass the same
  59 cases in `_fixtures/answers.json`.
- An unreadable expected answer throws, because it is a content error.
- **The server grades** (`AnswerChecker.php`). The client never receives what it would need to grade.

### 4.2 The `expression` evaluator

**Grammar.** A recursive-descent parser, written twice with one grammar. Neither copy uses `eval`, and a test checks this on both sides.

```
expr    := term (('+' | '-') term)*
term    := unary (('*' | '/') unary | <implicit product> power)*
unary   := ('-' | '+') unary | power
power   := primary ('^' unary)?              right-associative; -x^2 = -(x^2); 2^-1 allowed
primary := number | pi | e | variable | '(' expr ')' | '|' expr '|'
         | fn '(' expr ')' | fn unary        fn ∈ sqrt sin cos tan ln exp abs
```

**Reading conventions:**

- An implicit product has the precedence of a written product and reads left to right. `1/2x` is `(1/2)·x`.
- A function written without parentheses takes the next unary operand. `√3x` is `√3·x`, and `sin x^2` is `sin(x²)`.
- `e` is always the constant. Variables are single letters declared in `answer.vars`; any other letter, including an
  Arabic letter, is `unknown_symbol`.
- `|…|` cannot nest; use `abs()` for nested absolute values.

**Input normalisation**, identical on both sides:

- Arabic-Indic and Persian digits become Latin, and `٫` becomes `.`.
- Whitespace is removed.
- **`-:` becomes `/`** (MathLive writes `÷` as `-:` in ascii-math). This happens before the dashes are normalised.
- `− – —` become `-`, `× · ⋅` become `*`, `÷ ∕` become `/`, and `**` becomes `^`.
- `π` becomes `pi`, and `√` becomes `sqrt`.
- `\cdot \times \div \sqrt \pi \left \right` are rewritten or removed.
- `{ } [ ]` are read as parentheses.
- Superscripts `⁰…⁹` become `^n`.
- A comma between two digits is a decimal point.

MathLive's ascii-math (`(3+pi-3sqrt(3))/(3)x^2`, `3 * 4`, `12 -: 4`) is read as written. The fixture holds cases taken from
its real output.

**Errors and values:**

- Error codes are `empty`, `too_long` (more than 300 code points), `unknown_symbol`, `bad_number`, `unexpected_token`,
  `unbalanced` and `too_deep` (depth above 60).
- An undefined value is NaN. That covers ÷0, √ of a negative, ln ≤ 0, a negative base with a non-integer exponent,
  `0^negative`, and any non-finite result.
- **Canonical writing** (`normalized`) is fully parenthesised (`((x^2)*((1+(pi/3))-sqrt(3)))`). It is stored as
  `answer_norm` and used by the repeat rule.

**Equivalence:**

- Points are drawn by Park–Miller (×48271 mod 2³¹−1, seed `20261030`) in `domain[v] = {min, max, exclude[]}`, default
  [−4, 4], skipping points within 1e-3 of an excluded value, at most 8 × `samples` draws.
- At each point:
  - both values undefined: the point is skipped;
  - exactly one undefined: refused (`domain`);
  - values farther apart than `relTol` 1e-6 or `absTol` 1e-9: refused (`differs`).
- `samples` (default 6) agreeing points are needed; fewer than half defined is refused (`undefined`). A geometric challenge declares a positive domain.
- **Shared fixture** `_fixtures/expressions.json`: 226 cases (120 parse, 106 equivalence). Verdicts are authored, values
  come from independent formulas, and when PHP diverges, PHP is fixed.

The client-side `compareMathExpressions` (compute-engine) and the nerdamer facade are **not** used for grading.

### 4.3 Declared mistakes

`mistakes[]`: the first match gives `mistakeIndex`. Matches by value come first, then matches by range.

- **`{value, scaleWith?, reply}`** matches an answer equal to `value`. For an `expression` the comparison is with
  `(value)*(scaleWith)`.
- **`{value, outside: [lo, hi], at?, reply}`** matches any answer whose value at `at` is ≤ lo or ≥ hi. Here `value` is an
  example the validator refuses.

The reply is shown under « ليس بعد ». An undeclared wrong answer gets an order-of-magnitude sentence when the value is more
than ×10 away (`reply.kind = magnitude`, with no direction given). Otherwise it gets a generic sanity sentence
(`generic`). Both sentences live in `thinking.json`.

## 5. The content pipeline

### 5.1 `scripts/validate-thinking-lab.mjs [--strict] [--json]`

**Every run checks:**

- **Schema:** the file follows the schema, with `jsonSchemaSubset.mjs`. A schema keyword the subset does not handle is an error.
- **Identity:**
  - the file name is `NNNN-<id>.json`, and ids and numbers are unique;
  - the band follows the number, and `summit` is set exactly for multiples of 25;
  - `example` is present for the primary band only;
  - a published challenge has 3 keys;
  - a challenge is not its own twin;
  - `figure.component` exists as `apps/web/src/features/thinkingLab/figures/<Name>.jsx`.
- **Replay:** a replay of 6 steps or more has an `ask`, and `ask.correct` is one of the option indexes.
- **For every params tuple:**
  - no `{name}` is left unfilled in the statement, keys or replay;
  - the answer accepts itself, as the number a student would type (the exact value for `integer` and `rational`);
  - every mistake is readable, refused, and recognised as itself;
  - `parts` and `ceiling` answers are readable;
  - **nothing before the gate leaks the answer**. That covers the keys, the mistake replies and the example, whether
    the answer appears as text or as an equivalent value.
- **Forbidden words** (rule « Cultural and religious respect »):
  - Arabic whole words, with only the article allowed as a prefix (« برهان », « كبيرة » pass);
  - Arabic phrases, English words and emoji;
  - « عيد الميلاد » alone is allowed, because it also means a birthday.
- **Warning only:** a `twin` that does not exist yet.

**`--strict`** (the mode `check:lessons` runs) also requires: no `draft`, a fresh index, and at least one challenge in five
with a dead end (`B`).

### 5.2 The oracle

- `scripts/thinking-lab-oracle/<batch>.mjs` (one batch per band) exports `ORACLE[id] = { answer, ceiling?, parts?, tolerance? }`,
  each `(params, point) => value`. Every value is recomputed by an INDEPENDENT path, for example:
  - simulation: the snail day by day, Josephus on an array;
  - enumeration: coin combinations, permutations, draws;
  - search: BFS over the river crossing;
  - numerical integration: the #318 area, the lens;
  - BigInt arithmetic: 100!, 2¹⁰⁰ mod 7.
- `scripts/thinking-lab-oracle.test.mjs` checks, for every published challenge and every tuple:
  - expression answers against 12 points of the domain;
  - other checks by submitting the oracle's value to `checkAnswer`;
  - that every mistake is readable and refused;
  - that no published challenge lacks an oracle;
  - the phase-0 acceptance on #318.

### 5.3 The index and its deployment

- **The index:** `npm run build:thinking-lab-index` writes `content/thinking-lab/index.generated.json` as
  `{ $comment, count, challenges[] }`: the published challenges, complete, sorted by number. `--check` and `--strict` fail
  on a stale index.
- **Who reads it:** it is the only content file the server reads, through `ChallengeRepository` and
  `config('thinking_lab.content_path')` (default `base_path('../../content/thinking-lab')`).
- **Deployment:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml › Deploy the thinking-lab content` ships **only that file**, outside the web
  root, beside `content/practice/`.

### 5.4 How to add a challenge

1. Write `content/thinking-lab/challenges/<NNNN>-<id>.json` from the bank entry, in our own words with our own numbers.
2. If it has a figure, add `apps/web/src/features/thinkingLab/figures/<Name>.jsx` (§7.2).
3. Add its oracle to the batch of its band in `scripts/thinking-lab-oracle/`.
4. Run `npm run build:thinking-lab-index`, `npm run validate:thinking-lab -- --strict`,
   `npx vitest run --dir scripts thinking-lab` and `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/features/thinkingLab`.
5. Look at the figure: render it and view the PNG.
6. Set `status: "published"`; nothing generated stays `draft`.
7. Update the challenge bank's status line.

## 6. The ladder and the gate (implemented, phase 1)

**Tables:**

- `thinking_lab_progress` holds one row per (student, challenge): `state` (`trying`, `solved` or `learned`),
  `attempts_counted`, `keys_opened`, `first_attempt_at`, `last_counted_at`, `solved_at`, `learned_at`, `outcome`
  (`alone`, `keys`, `learned` or `twin`), `params_index`, `edition`, `postponed_at` and `extras` (solved parts and ceiling).
- `thinking_lab_attempts` holds every submission, counted or not, with `answer_raw`, `answer_norm`, `correct`,
  `counted`, `reason`, `mistake_index`, `draft` and `created_at`.
- Both have `user_id` foreign keys with cascade delete, so account deletion removes them. `challenge_id` is the content
  slug, never a foreign key.

**Config:** every threshold below is in `config/thinking_lab.php`, never in the code.

### 6.1 The ladder (`LadderService`)

- The first number is always reachable. Number *n* becomes reachable once the student has **one counted attempt** on
  the number before it, or has solved or learned it. The student is never stuck behind a challenge.
- The **twin** of a challenge the student has passed is reachable at once.
- At most **`max_open` = 3** challenges are open (in progress and not postponed). A new or resumed attempt beyond
  that is refused with `too_many_open` (409, carrying `maxOpen`).
- **« أرجئه »** (`postpone`) frees a place and keeps the state. Attempting the challenge again resumes it, if a place
  is free.
- A student's status per number is `solved`, `learned`, `trying`, `postponed`, `open` or `locked`.

### 6.2 An attempt (`GateService::attempt`)

The check runs inside a transaction locked on the `users` row.

- A **correct** answer is always counted and solves the challenge. The outcome is `alone`, or `keys` if any key was opened.
- A **wrong** answer is counted only if it is honest (plan §6.1). The refusal reasons are checked in this order:

  | Reason | When |
  |---|---|
  | `syntax` | the answer is unreadable |
  | `repeat` | it equals a previously counted answer: the same canonical writing, or for an expression, an equivalent one |
  | `too_soon` | less than `honest.min_seconds_between` = 120 s since the last counted attempt |
  | `no_draft` | from the 2nd attempt, the draft « ماذا غيّرت هذه المرّة؟ » is shorter than `honest.min_draft_chars` = 12 |

- An answer that is not counted is still stored, with its reason.

### 6.3 Keys

Key *k* is unlocked after counted attempt *k*. Keys open **in order** (`k ≤ keys_opened + 1`). A key is refused with
`key_locked` before it is unlocked, and with `closed` once the gate is passed. Each key is stored with its phase. The key
stake belongs to phase 4.

### 6.4 The gate and the replay

- **When it opens:** `unlockAt = first_attempt_at + think_hours` once `attempts_counted ≥ attempts_to_unlock`.
  - The defaults are 3 attempts and 24 h; the primary band waits 0 h.
  - Time is the server's clock and stored in UTC; the screen shows it in Africa/Algiers.
- **Before it opens:** `GET …/replay` answers `gate_closed` (403).
- **Opening it:** the first read after it opens turns `trying` into `learned` (outcome `learned`).
- **Twin credit:** solving the twin **alone** afterwards turns the original's outcome into `twin` (plan §6).
- **Afterwards:**
  - attempts and keys answer `closed` (409);
  - the summit `parts` and « ارفع السقف » become checkable through `POST …/extra`, with no attempt limit and nothing
    revealed.
- **Who follows this rule (phase 1):** every student, independent or in a class. The teacher request is phase 2, and the
  plan's 48 h fallback already returns a request to this rule.

### 6.5 What reaches the client (`ChallengePresenter`)

**Before the gate the client receives:**

- the number, `summit`, `examTag`, the filled statement and figure, and the example;
- the **answer format** only: `check`, `vars`, `percent`, and the choices without the correct id;
- each key's phase and state, with the text of **opened** keys only;
- the state, and the student's own attempts with their replies.

**It never receives** the answer, its domain or tolerances, the mistake values, a closed key's text, the replay,
`keyMoves`, `move`, the ceiling and parts answers, `band`, `family`, `rating`, `title` or `source`.

**After the gate**, `GET …/replay` adds: the replay, `keyMoves`, `move`, every key, the parts and ceiling (prompts and
formats), the twin with its status, and the answer value for display.

`ThinkingLabLeakTest` plays every pre-gate endpoint and searches the raw JSON for each secret (933 assertions).

### 6.6 API (student: `learner` middleware, then `FeatureRegistry::THINKING_LAB_LADDER`)

```
GET  /thinking-lab                                 home: trail, open challenges with state, next, totals
GET  /thinking-lab/n/{number}                      number → stable id (shared links cite the number)
GET  /thinking-lab/challenges/{id}                 the presented challenge (403 locked)
POST /thinking-lab/challenges/{id}/attempts        {answer, draft} → {attempt: {counted, correct, outcome, reason, reply}, challenge}
POST /thinking-lab/challenges/{id}/keys/{k}        → {challenge}
POST /thinking-lab/challenges/{id}/postpone        → {home}
GET  /thinking-lab/challenges/{id}/replay          → {replay}  (403 gate_closed)
POST /thinking-lab/challenges/{id}/extra           {kind: ceiling|part, index?, answer} → {correct, outcome}
```

The refusal reasons are `not_found` (404), `locked`, `gate_closed` and `key_locked` (403), `too_many_open` and `closed`
(409), and `not_started` (422).

**Access:**

- **Feature key:** `thinking_lab.ladder` (group `thinking_lab`, no quota). It is open to both tiers until the admin closes
  it in « الوصول والحدود » (§17 n° 4, proposed). `ACCESS_AND_LIMITS.md` §3 lists it.
- **Not open to teachers:** the routes are student-only (`learner`); a teacher gets a 403.

## 7. Screens (implemented, phase 1)

### 7.1 Routes, layout and rules

- **Routes:** `/espace/tafkir` (screen 1), `/espace/tafkir/:challengeId` (screens 2 and 3) and `/espace/tafkir/n/:number`
  (redirect). They sit inside `StudentLayout`, behind `RequireLargeScreen` (≥ 768 px), as `lazy()` pages.
- **Navigation:** `data/studentNavigation.js` (lucide `Brain`, `nav.thinkingLab` / `nav.thinkingLabShort`).
- **Screen 1, the ladder (`LadderHome`):**
  - the next number, in a large card, with its start button. When 3 challenges are open it says why it cannot start.
  - the open challenges (at most 3), each with its **state in words** (`stateLines`: « محاولة 2 من 3 · الحلّ يُفتح غدًا 09:40 »);
  - while a challenge waits for its day, light activities: a maths game, or another challenge;
  - the trail of numbered stones in RTL, coloured by status, summits larger, locked stones with a padlock.
- **Screen 2, the workspace (`Workspace`):**
  - the example card (primary band), the statement and the figure;
  - the draft, which is highlighted until it is long enough;
  - the answer, in `AnswerInput`: MathLive with the **thinking keyboard** `thinkingKeyboard(vars)` (π, √, x², xⁿ, a/b, |x|,
    and the challenge's variables), or choice cards;
  - **one primary action « تحقّق »**, plus « أرجئه »;
  - the verdict in a live region: « ليس بعد » in **amber, never red**, followed by the mistake reply or the generic or
    magnitude sentence, and the reason when the attempt was not counted;
  - the keys (locked, available or open), each with its phase chip;
  - the student's attempts;
  - « شاهد كيف فكّر الرياضي » once `canReplay`.
- **Screen 3, after the gate (`AfterSolve`):**
  - the statement and the answer;
  - **solved alone:** the key moves first, with « شاهد العرض الكامل » for the full replay. **Otherwise:** the replay;
  - then « ماذا تأخذ معك؟ » (the move card), the summit parts, the twin and « ارفع السقف ».
- **Mathematics:**
  - `MathRun` renders Arabic text with its math islands (`mathRuns`) in `<bdi dir="ltr">` **inline-block**, so a formula
    that wraps stays LTR. `( |` start an island only when maths follows.
  - Plain Unicode is the content format: `½`, `…`, `°`, `²`.
  - `prettyMath` prints an ascii answer for the eye (`x²×(1+π/3−√3)`).
- **Sound and motion:** sound is off by default, through the platform's single « الصوت » switch (`EffectsToggle` +
  `useEffectsPreference`), and reduced motion is respected (`MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`).

### 7.2 Figures (`features/thinkingLab/figures/`)

**One file per figure**, found by a lazy `import.meta.glob`, so no list needs maintaining. Each figure exports:

- `LAYERS`: every layer it can draw;
- `BASE_LAYERS`: the layers of the statement;
- a default `({ layers, props, ariaLabel }) => <svg>` drawn in code from `props` (the student's numbers), using
  `palette.js` colours (never red), LTR letters and numbers (`ltrText`), and **computed** geometry. No raster image.

**A replay step's `layers` are ADDED to `BASE_LAYERS`.** The square and its arcs stay on screen when the triangle is lit.
A step without `layers` keeps the last ones shown.

`figures.test.jsx` checks the contract and renders every figure with its base layers and with all its layers: an `<svg>`,
no raster, no NaN. It also checks that every replay layer of every challenge exists in its figure.

There are 15 figures on 2026-11-01:

- FourArcs, Lens, IncircleRight and GridPaths;
- HandshakeCircle, SnailWell, FencePosts, RiverCrossing and BalanceNine;
- TiltedSquare, SlidingLadder, OddGnomons and TreeShadow;
- ChocolateBar and JosephusCircle.

The river (#33) and the balance (#47) are static in phase 1. Playing them is not in V1.

### 7.3 The replay player (`ReplayPlayer`)

- **Cursor:** it runs on the Math Lab step player (`useStepReveal` / `stepPlayerModel`): manual or auto, back, restart.
  The cursor is interface state and is never serialised.
- **Layout:** the current step leads, and earlier steps sit in a collapsed « الخطوات السابقة ». Below `lg`, the step column
  comes first.
- **The `math` lines** accumulate in a dark notebook « دفتر الحساب ».
- **An `ask` step (« اشرح لنفسك »)** pauses auto-play and blocks « التالي » until the student chooses. The choice is shown
  as right or « ليس بعد », followed by `why`.

### 7.4 Sounds

These names are added to `playSfx`:

| Sound | When |
|---|---|
| `lock` | a key opens |
| `spark` | an O step |
| `slide` | a B step |
| `notyet` | two soft falling notes, never a buzzer |
| `stepTick` | each replay step |

A solved challenge plays `playMedal('gold')`. All of them are silent unless « الصوت » is on (`MANIPULATION_CONTRACT.md`
« Sound effects »).

## 8. Open decisions in effect (plan §17)

Phase 1 met these decisions and applies the **proposed** values, all in config:

| § | Value in effect | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | not reached yet: the 48 h fallback is phase 2 | — |
| 4 | the ladder is free and open to all students | `FeatureRegistry` default (no row) |
| 5 | the edition is a school term; edition 1 is current | `thinking_lab.edition` |
| 6 | a summit counts as an attempt like any number; its `parts` are follow-ups | `GateService` |
| — | the honest-attempt thresholds: 120 s, 12 characters | `thinking_lab.honest.*` |
| — | at most 3 open challenges | `thinking_lab.max_open` |
| — | the primary band has no day lock | `thinking_lab.gate.primary_think_hours` = 0 |

## 9. Planned (phases 2–7, plan §8–§15)

- **Phase 2 · Class flow:**
  - the request to the teacher and the grouped queue with its badge;
  - accept, key or in-class, and the 48 h job;
  - notifications, `ClassroomAccess`, the Classroom Mode replay and the teacher settings.
- **Phase 3 · Writing:**
  - the whiteboard seed and observation detection (« لاحظت! »);
  - frozen board snapshots with a red layer;
  - photos through a shared `ImageEncoder`, with a quota.
- **Phase 4 · Motivation:**
  - points and the key stake;
  - the streak of thinking days, move cards and summits;
  - the pseudonymous weekly league;
  - the cooperative class challenge;
  - the morning reminder.
- **Phase 5:** content to 150 challenges.
- **Phase 6:** path 2.
- **Phase 7:** ratings and the edition renumbering.

## 10. Tests

| Suite | File | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Vitest (core) | `packages/core/thinkingLab/{expression,checkAnswer,params}.test.js` | the three shared fixtures, no `eval`, the #318 acceptance |
| PHPUnit (unit) | `tests/Unit/ThinkingLab/{ExpressionEvaluatorFixtureTest,AnswerCheckerFixtureTest}.php` | the same fixtures, PHP side |
| PHPUnit (feature) | `tests/Feature/ThinkingLabFlowTest.php` | the plan's phase-1 acceptance (1 → 2 → 3 attempts → +24 h, time travelled), honest-attempt refusals, keys, reach, open places, postpone, the primary band, twin credit, extras, access |
| PHPUnit (feature) | `tests/Feature/ThinkingLabLeakTest.php` | no answer, closed key or replay in any pre-gate response |
| Vitest (scripts) | `scripts/validate-thinking-lab.test.mjs`, `scripts/thinking-lab-oracle.test.mjs` | each validator rule; the oracle for all 46 challenges |
| Vitest (web) | `features/thinkingLab/{thinkingModel,serverOnly}.test.js`, `figures/figures.test.jsx` | state in words, math islands, Algiers time; the server-only content; every figure and every replay layer |
| Gate | `npm run validate:thinking-lab -- --strict` (in `check:lessons`) | §5.1 |

The feature tests use a fixed content (`tests/Support/ThinkingLabFixtures.php`): the real #318 plus synthetic challenges
with marker strings, so the tests do not move when the bank grows.
